<STRONG>2011-9-29: We have added liver gene expression data for many strains of mice from </STRONG><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE16780" target=_blank>GEO series GSE16780</a>. These data were generated by Dr. Jake Lusis and colleagues at UCLA and are currently listed as a BXD data set, although the study actually includes many other strains (see "GSE16780 UCLA Hybrid MDP Liver Affy HT M430A (Sep11) RMA". Since adding the data we have discovered errors in strain assignment that affect a majority of the conventional inbred strains and several RI strains. For this reason, these data should still be considered provisional.

<STRONG>2011-7-5: </STRONG><b>Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center/ Merck Research Laboratories</b>. This study aims at identifying functional variation in the human genome (especially as it pertains to brain expressed RNAs) and elucidate its relationship to disease and drug response. The ~800 individuals in this dataset are composed of approximately 400 Alzheimers disease (AD) cases, 230 Huntington's Disease and 170 controls matched for age, gender, and post mortem interval (PMI).  The tissue specimens for this study were provided by Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center (HBTRC).<p>  
Three brain regions (cerebellum, visual cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) from the same individuals were profiled on a custom-made Agilent 44K microarray of 39,280 DNA probes uniquely targeting 37,585 known and predicted genes, including splice variants, miRNAs and high-confidence non-coding RNA sequences. The individuals were genotyped on two different platforms, the Illumina HumanHap650Y array and a custom Perlegen 300K array (a focused panel for detection of singleton SNPs). Clinical outcomes available include age at onset, age at death, Braak scores (AD), Vonsattel scores (HD), Regional brain enlargement/atrophy.<p>
<b>Acknowledgements</b>. The Harvard Brain dataset was contributed by Merck Pharmaceutical through the Sage Bionetworks Repository.

<STRONG>2011-2-9: </STRONG><B>INIA Amygdala BLA Affy MoGene 1.0 ST (Nov10)</B>: <P>This is a final error-checked release of an amygdala gene expression data set generated by Khyobeni Mozhui, Lu Lu, and Robert W. Williams and colleagues with funding support from the NIH NIAAA. The basolateral complex of the amygdala of untreated young adult mice was profiled using the Affymetrix GeneChip <A HREF="http://www.affymetrix.com/browse/products.jsp?productId=131476&categoryId=35765#1_1">Mouse Gene 1.0 ST</A> array that contains approximately 34,728 probe sets that target approximately 29,000 well defined transcripts (RefSeq mRNA isoforms) and essentially all known protein coding genes in mouse. This array is an "exon style" array with multiple probes in all known exons of each gene (an average of about 27 per gene) and is an abridged version of the Affymetrix Exon 1.0 ST array. However, it also does contain some probes that target non-coding RNAs and even miRNA precursors (search "ncrna").<br>

<STRONG>2011-2-3: </STRONG><B>OHSU HS-CC Striatum ILM6v1 (Feb11) RankInv</B>: The current study focused on the extent genetic diversity within a species (Mus musculus) affects gene
co-expression network structure. To examine this issue, we have created a new mouse resource, a heterogeneous
stock (HS) formed from the same eight inbred strains that have been used to create the collaborative cross (CC). The
eight inbred strains capture > 90% of the genetic diversity available within the species. For contrast with the HS-CC, a
C57BL/6J (B6) × DBA/2J (D2) F2 intercross and the HS4, derived from crossing the B6, D2, BALB/cJ and LP/J strains,
were used. Brain (striatum) gene expression data were obtained using the Illumina Mouse WG 6.1 array, and the data
sets were interrogated using a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA).<br>

<STRONG>2010-08-02:</STRONG> <A HREF="http://www.genenetwork.org/webqtl/main.py?FormID=tissueCorrelation" class="normalsize"  target="_empty">Tissue Correlation and Expression Level Services</A>: We have added a new web interface that allows you to directly evaluate differences in gene expression across 30 different tissue types. 

<P>The current version is mainly meant for testing. The interface still needs work.We have a long list of improvements in the works, but please send us your ideas. To test drive the tissue correlation feature you currently need to enter a set of mouse GeneID numbers. For example <I><A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/11820">App</A></I> is  NCBI Enbrez Gene ID 11820.  <I><A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23821">Bace</A></I> is Gene ID 23821. If you enter these two numbers in the interface and then click your heels twice. You should get back a simple matrix of values that lists both Pearson and Spearman correlations based on a comparison of expression in 25 tissue types. Click on the correlation values and this will pop up two scatterplots (Pearson and Spearman types).

<P>At the same time, this tool provides expression estimates for both genes, where a value of 8 in the Pearson plot represents the mean across all tissues and each unit represents a two-fold difference (log2 expression; Spearman rank values are just that--rank out of 25). To access this new feature select <B>Search -> Tissue Correlation</B>. All of the expression data are taken from on C57BL/6J litter mates studied using the Illumina Mouse 6 2.0 array (Implemented by Ning Liu, data from Lu Lu, RW Williams, and Xusheng Wang).

These are large (n > 250), powerful, and well structured data sets from a single cohort of highly recombinant outcrossed mice that have a genetic architecture similar to that of human populations. All tissue was taken from non-inbred mice generated by systematically outcrossing a stock of eight inbred strains by Robert Hitzemann and colleagues (A/J, AKR/J, BALBc/J, CBA/J, C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, and LP/J).

<P>All correlation and network graphing functions are currently implemented in GeneNetwork. You can generate correlation matrices, graphs, and compute partial correlations. However, QTL mapping has not yet been implemented for these three data sets.

<STRONG>2010-05-18: </STRONG>Partial Correlations can now be calculated in GeneNetwork. We have integrated <A HREF="http://www.r-project.org/">R Project</A> code to compute up to third order partial correlations. This makes it possible to compute the correlation between X and Y traits while controlling for the possible confounding effects of three other variables, for example the age of cases, experimental groups, or even a genetic marker. To use the Partial Correlation feature, please add X, Y, and the possible confounder traits or markers into a Collection. Then just look for the Partial Correlation icon and text.

<STRONG>2009-08-24: </STRONG><B><A HREF="http://faculty.chass.ncsu.edu/garson/PA765/partialr.htm">PARTIAL CORRELATIONS</A></B> have been implemented in GeneNetwork on the <A HREF="http://alexandria.uthsc.edu:85">beta test site</A> and will soon be move to our production site. You can now compute correlations between a "reference trait" and any other large set of traits while controlling for variability associated with up to three other factors. For example, it is possible to compute the correlation between the expression of the gene formin 2 (<I>Fmn2</I>) and all other 45,000 probe sets in the BXD hippocampus data set while controlling for the effects of the genotype at the location of the <I>Fmn2</I> gene itself. This is done by using the SNP rs6375522 that is located in <I>Fmn2</I>as a controlled cofactor. In this particular situation the partial correlation then provides you with a measure of the association between differences in formin 2 expression and all other transcripts in the absence of genetic variation in formin 2 itself. Partial correlations are a great way to study correlations between genes with control for sometimes unwanted sources of variability--linkage with neighboring genes being one important unwanted source. Partial correlations can also be used to remove effects of sex, age, batch effect, etc. Users can upload their own "correction" factors that can be used to calculate partial correlations.

In addition, the QTL heat maps can be clustered, as usual, by trait correlations--the Cluster Map function developed originall by Elissa Chesler.

Samples were laser-captured from cortical layer 3 (except the hippocampus) and run on the Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 array. We renormalized the data to an average expression of 8 units on a log2 scale. Two versions of the data have been entered in GeneNetwork: one consisting of 157 of 161 arrays; the second consisting of what we regard as the best 102 arrays (those with mean correlations of better than 0.88 with all other arrays). Case IDs have the following code structure: Brain Region, GEO ID, Sex, Age, Disease Status. E119615M63N is a sample of the entorhinal cortex of case GSM119615, a male 63 year old normal case. The tissue codes are E = enorhinal cortex, H = hippocampus pyramidal layer, MT = medial temporal cortex, PC = porterior cingulate cortex, SP = supeior frontal cortex,  V = primary visual cortex. GeneNetwork does not allow sophisticated display of the data, but you can perform correlation analyses of any of the 56,000 probe sets. For example expression of the <I>APP</I> transcript is higher in the AD cases and correlates well with many other AD related genes. At least 7.5% of cases are assigned incorrectly by sex (see <A HREF="http://www.genenetwork.org/dbdoc/GSE5281_F_RMA0709.html" class="fs14"  target="_empty">INFO</A> file) (Implementation by Robert W.

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>2008-9-15: </STRONG><B>GN code improvement by cleaning up "namespace pollution"</B> Every GN python module used to import other module by "from SomeModule import *" so that the class, function and variable of the imported module can be used without the imported module name as prefix. Since one typical GN python module imports over ten modules, and GN python modules always import other GN python modules like chain (B import A, C import B, D import C ...), the namespace is seriously polluted. It not only makes the source code very difficult to read (for anything not defined in current module, programmer may have look up dozens of imported modules to find where it is defined), but also makes the dependency among modules unclear, so the change to one module always has "unpredictable" effects to other modules. As GN software keeps growing, the namespace pollution problem keeps building up and make it harder and harder to maintain the software and develop new features. A lot of effort has been made to change all GN python module to import module by "import SomeModule", and add the module's name as prefix to the the class, function and variable of the imported module (thousands of places). This work not only greatly improves the source code readability, but also make the dependency among GN python modules clear, hence much easier for maintenance and future development.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>2008-01-20: </STRONG>  GeneNetwork consists of a cluster of servers that have identical software code and identical databases. The creation of the individual servers (bundles) that are part of the GN cluster is quite complicated. Each bundle consists of an application stack (Linux CENT OS 5, MySQL 5.0, Apache HTTP server, Mod_Python, and many code libraries and scripts). Components of the bundles ideally work well regardless of the physical hardware and network configuration. We have now rewritten and annotated the GN code and reconfigured bundles to make them as independent as possible from their particular network situation. We refer to this effort as "de-hardcoding" or refactoring GN. GN bundles are now easy to be deployed with minimum manual work. The following tasks still need to be done: configuration of IP addresses, specification of absolute directory structure as DocumentRoot for Apache, recompilation of certain third-party Python libraries according to hardware infrastructure (i386 vs X64_86).(Implemented by Fan Zhang). The number of bundle servers has been increased to six.

SGO is a patented algorithm based on <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis"  class="fs14"  target="_empty"><I>latent semantic analysis</I></A> that provides a score of the terminological overlap between any two genes based on PubMed records and abstracts (M Berry, Kevin Heinrich, R Homayouni, and colleagues). These scores range from 0 to 1 (cosine similarity) and can be used like correlation coefficients, although all values are positive. GeneNetwork provides the Literature Correlations along with expression level correlations in most Correlation Table output pages. Roughly 5% of literature correlations have an r value greater than 0.6. The Literature Correlation covers roughly 75% of known genes in mouse, rat, and human.

<P>The new 2007 dataset covers 21,903 genes and was derived from a corpus consisting of 242,365 MEDLINE abstracts.  (The previous literature correlation dataset dated back to 2005 and was derived from a set of 108,367 abstracts covering 13,129 genes.) 

<P>We have also added a new <b>SGO Literature Correlation</b> feature to the <b>Trait Data and Analysis Form</b>.

To try this feature select one of the <B>Calculate:</B> SGO Literature Correlation options in the <B>Trait Correlations</B> part of the Trait Data and Analysis form. Normally GeneNetwork computes correlations based on expression and then provides the literature correlation as a secondary data type. This new feature reverses the situation; now the literature correlation is primary and the expression data are given as a secondary data type. This is a quick and powerful way to determine whether expression data support particular correlations extracted from the literature.

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>2007-04-25: </STRONG>GeneNetwork's <A HREF="http://www.genenetwork.org/CGIDoc.html" class="fs14" target="_empty">Scriptable Interface</A> is now being extended at the request of Dr. Graeme Wistow of the National Eye Institute NEIBank so that external users and bioinformatics site developers can directly access the "best" data for particular genes and transcripts from specific data sets. 

<P>For example, it is now possible to link directly to the <B>Basic Statistics</B> data page for the expression of the rhodopsin gene in the eyes of BXD mouse strains using a string that has this form:

<DIR>
"http://www.genenetwork.org/webqtl/main.py?FormID=showBest&gene=Rho&database=Eye_M2_0906_R" (no line break)
<BR>

<BR>where "gene=Rho" can be replaced by "refseq=NM_145383" to retrieve data using the RefSeq identifier (do not use the decimal point and digit that may follow, such as "refseq=NM_145383.1"), or can be replaced by "geneid=212541" to retrieve data using the Entrez Gene identifier. 

<BR><BR>Although not recommended, the string "&searchAlias=1" can be added at the end of the command to retrieve data using the alias of a proper gene symbol when the original does not work. Thus "gene=RP4" will resolve to "gene=Rho" only if you add "&searchAlias=1" at the end of the command.
</DIR>

<P>When a particular gene is associated with more than one probe or probe set, our code selects <B>the single probe or probe set</B> with the highest average expression in that particular data set. For example, there are four probe sets that traget different parts of rhodopsin mRNAs. Using the Affymetrix M430 2.0 array, probe set 1425172_at has the highest expression in the eyes of BXD strains (the probes target the last two exons and the proximal 3' UTR).

<P>To choose a particular data set one needs to know the appropriate code, such as Eye-M2_0906_R in the example above. These codes can currently be obtained from:

<DIR>
"http://www.genenetwork.org/webqtl/main.py?cmd=help&parse=machine"

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>2007-03-23: </STRONG>We have annotated Illumina's Sentrix Mouse-6 1.0 microarray BeadArray platform (see Mouse LXS Hippocampus data sets). We have added or corrected gene assignments, symbols, and gene descriptions for almost all of the 46,166 Illumina probes. We added many data types not provided by Illumina and the MEEBO consortium in their original annotation files (http://www.microarray.org/data/download/MEEBO_Data.txt), including updated Entrez Gene IDs, gene ontology categories, human orthologs, OMIM identifiers, and the precise locations of the 50-mer probe sequences on the most recent mouse genome assembly (Feb 2006, mm8). Some helpful metrics on this annotation: For 46166 probes on the Mouse 6 array platform (including control probes) we have identified 36687 NCBI Entrez Gene IDs; 26180 matched human Gene IDs; 23899 matched rat Gene IDs; 26882 NCBI HomoloGene IDs; and 12790 OMIM IDs. Position data for the 50-mer Illumina Mouse-6 array were BLAT aligned to the latest mouse genome assembly by Hongqiang Li. Many of the probes and alignments have been error-checked to a limited extent by RWW. Annotation is still continuing and we will be adding new data over the next several months.

This map shows a locus that modulates the expression of the <I>Cart</I> transcript (cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript) on distal Chr 10 in BXD mouse strains (brain tissue). The <B>Control Block</B>, top middle, permits users to customize the display and its resolution. Pink, blue, and beige horizontal bars above the map provide links to higher resolution maps (8x) or to the UCSC and ENSEMBL genome browsers. Statistical thresholds for linkage are marked by grey and pink horizontal lines and are based on 2,000 permutations. The Y-axis provides a scale for the plot of LRS or LOD scores that are plotted using a thicker blue line. The calculation of linkage statistics are based on a total of 147 useful markers that have been genotyped in all 89 BXD strains (The Wellcome-CTC Mouse Strain SNP database with added microsatellite markers). The far more digital look of the LRS function that traditional interval maps arises for the simple reason that locations of recombinations in this cross have been precisely defined and only a fewer regions exploit a true interval mapping approach (see News item of 2005-06-17 for additional detail). </SMALL></P>

<P><SMALL>The thinner red and green lines and the right Y-axis display the additive effect size; green for high alleles inherited from one parent (DBA/2J in this example), and red for high alleles from the other parent (C57BL/6J). The units are log2 expression differences where 0.2 is equivalent to a 2^0.2-fold difference. The large number of closely packed tick marks along the top of the map show locations of genes on Chr 10. Gene blocks are color coded by the average density of SNPs per gene using a rainbow color sequence with low density in the blue/green spectrum and high density in orange/red spectrum. The bright orange hash marks along the X-axis provide a graphic estimate of numbers of SNPs that are segregating in the BXD strains in any particular chromosomal region. A long interval from 30 Mb to 65 Mb is almost identical by descent between the two parental strains. </SMALL></P>

<P><SMALL>Many regions of these maps are responsive to a mouse click. For example, the name and size of any gene can be determined by simply placing the mouse cursor over its mark. The same applies to the significance thresholds and the SNP track. Below each of these maps is a complete list of known genes in the interval with numerous links to other data types, including information on expression, lists of known SNPs in each gene, and corresponding regions of the human genome.

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>2005-06-17: </STRONG><B>New High Density Mapping Algorithm</B> that exploits the Wellcome-CTC SNP data has been implemented for the BXD mouse genetic reference populations on both public and beta sites. In the case of the BXD panel (BXD1 through BXD100), the merged SNP and microsatellite maps are based on a total of 7636 informative markers that differ between the parental strains, C57BL/6J (B) and DBA/2J (D). The locations of these makers are known on the latest assembly of the mouse genome (Build 34, mm6). The median distance between markers in this subset is 178,831 bp. The mean distance is 324,493 bp. There are only 26 intervals between markers that are longer than 5 Mb. No interval is greater than 10 Mb except on Chr X. These long intervals are essentially monomorphic between the parental strains. 

<P>The new algorithm exploits a selected subset of 3795 markers that includes all markers with unique strain distribution patterns (<A HREF="http://www.genenetwork.org/glossary.html#SDP" target="_blank" class="fs14">SDP</A>), as well as pairs of markers (the most proximal and most distal markers) for SDPs represented by two or more markers. This BXD genotype data set can be downloaded by ftp at <A HREF="ftp://atlas.utmem.edu/public/BXD_WebQTL_Genotypes_June05.txt" target="_blank" class="fs14">ftp://atlas.utmem.edu/public/BXD_WebQTL_Genotypes_June05.txt</A>.

<P>The mapping algorithm is a mixture of simple marker regression, linear interpolation, and standard Haley-Knott interval mapping. If two adjacent markers have identical SDPs they will have identical linkage statistics, as will the entire interval between the markers (assuming complete and error-free haplotype data for all strains). On a physical map the <A HREF="http://www.genenetwork.org/glossary.html#LRS" target="_blank" class="fs14">LRS</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.genenetwork.org/glossary.html#additive" target="_blank" class="fs14">additive effect</A> values will therefore be constant over this interval. Between neighboring markers that are separated by 1 cM or more we use a conventional interval mapping method (Haley-Knott) combined with a Haldane estimate of genetic distance. When the interval is less than 1 cM we simply interpolate linearly based on a physical scale between the markers. The result of this <B>mixture mapping algorithm</B> is a map of the trait that has an unusal profile that is particular striking on a physical (Mb) scale, with many plateaus, abrupt linear transitions between plateaus, and a few regions with the standard graceful curves typical of interval maps.</P>

<P>The same procedure will soon be implemented for other mouse GRPs, including AXB/BXA, CXB, BXH, and AKXD.

<P>For users that would like reference access to the old set of genotypes, we will set up an Archive site with the May 2005 microsatellite markers and maps.

Until May 2005, all genetic maps of recombinant inbred strains of mice in WebQTL have relied heavily on a set of roughly 1500 microsatellite markers genotyped across all RI sets by the Informatics Center for Mouse Neurogenetics (Williams et al., 2001; Peirce, Lu et al, 2004). In collaboration with members of the CTC (Richard Mott, Jonathan Flint and colleagues), we have helped genotype a total of 480 strains using a panel of 13,377 SNPs. More than half of the SNPs are informative in most crosses. These SNPs have been combined with microsatellites to produce new consensus maps for BXD and other GRPs using the latest mouse genome assembly as a reference frame (Build 34 - mm6). In the case of the BXD GRP, a total of 88 strains were genotyped using the full set of SNPs of which 7482 are informative. The order of markers given in WebQTL is essentially the same as that given in Build 34. To reduce false positive errors when mapping using this ultradense map, we have eliminated most single genotypes that generate double-recombinant haplotypes. Double-recombinant haplotypes are most commonly produced by typing errors ("smoothed" genotypes).

<P>The first of these is the <B>Compare Correlates</B> tool. This function is available in Selection Windows. It is essentially a Venn diagram set tool. Instead of providing simple graphs, it provides lists of traits in different parts of a virtual Venn diagram. For example, to find traits that covary with Sonic Hedgehog, Indian Hedgehog, Desert Hedgehog, Patched1, and Gli3, you would select five key transcripts into a <B>Selections</B> window (use the "Add Selection" tool and then select a group of traits in the Selections window). Compare Correlates allows you to chose the target database to which the key traits will be correlated. Compare Correlates was designed by Elissa Chesler and Stephen Pitts. Code was written and optimized by Stephen Pitts. </P>

<P>The second new tool is <B>Network Graph</B>. This function displays a set of traits and their correlations in the form of a graph with nodes (traits) and lines (correlations). There are quite a few tunable parameters, including the correlation threshold used to draw (or not draw) a line between nodes. To use this new tool, you again need to have traits loaded into one of the Selections windows. Network Graph was designed by Elissa Chesler and Stephen Pitts.

<Blockquote><STRONG>2004-10-24: </STRONG>Updated positions of all Mouse Expression U74Av2, 430A, 430B, and 430 2.0 probe sets using the May 2004 (mm5) assembly of the mouse genome. This work was carried out by Yanhua Qu. The M430 data consists of 45,000 probe sets. Positions were obtained using a series of methods: Method 1. A BLAT analysis of the actual probe sequence using a 48-processor cluster (our thanks to Yan Cui). Roughly 90% of all probe sets were mapped using this method. If the probe sequence did not BLAT with a score above 99 AND an identity match of 100, then we used Method 2: We used the position of the probe set given in the <A HREF="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm5/database/UCSC" target="_blank" class="fs14"> affMOE430.txt.gz</A> data file. This method recovered position data for approximaely 5% of all probe sets. If Method 2 failed, then we used Method 3: We obtained the position given by <A HREF="http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=moe430" target="_blank" class="fs14">Affymetrix</A> in the files called "MOE430A Annotations, CSV (6.3 Mb, 10/12/04)" and  "MOE430B Annotations, CSV (3.9 Mb, 10/12/04)". This method recovered positions on roughly 4%. As a last resort we used Method 4: We retained position data from mm4 or mm3 without interpolation. No position data would be found for 198 records and no chromosome could be found for 46 probe sets.  We estimate that 5 to 10% of position data are unreliable.
