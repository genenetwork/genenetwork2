<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary:</P>

<blockquote>
<p>The July 2006 Kidney QTL Consortium data set provides estimates
of mRNA expression in the adult kidney of 70 genetically diverse
strains of mice including 54 BXD recombinant inbred strains, a set
of 15 inbred strains, and 1 F1 hybrid; D2B6F1. Kidney samples were
processed using a total of 153 Affymetrix Mouse Expression 430 2.0
microarrays (M430v2.0). This particular data set was processed using
the RMA protocol. </p>

<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the strains used to generate this set of data:</P>

<!--BXD42 samples did not pass QC -->

<blockquote>
<P>The <A HREF="http://www.genenetwork.org/mouseCross.html#BXD" target="_empty" class="fs14">BXD</A> genetic reference panel of recombinant inbred strains consists of just over 80 strains. The BXDs in this data set include 30 of the BXD strains made by Benjamin Taylor at the Jackson Laboratory in the 1970s and 1990s (BXD1 through BXD42). All of these strains are fully inbred. We have also included 24 BXD lines generated by Lu and Peirce. All of these strains have been genotyped at 13,377 SNPs.

<blockquote>
<P><B>Mouse Diversity Panel (MDP)</B>. We have profiled a MDP consisting 15 inbred strains and a pair of F1 hybrids; D2B6F1. These strains were selected for the following reasons:
This panel will be a powerful tool in systems genetic analysis of a wide variety of traits, and will provide additional power in fine mapping modulators through an association analysis of sequence variants.

<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the animals and tissue used to generate this set of data:</P>

<Blockquote><P>BXD animals were obtained from UTHSC, and the Jackson Laboratory (Table 1). Animals were housed at UTHSC, at Harvard/BIDMC (Glenn Rosen), at the University of Memphis (Douglas Matthews), or the Jackson Laboratory before sacrifice (see Table 1). Mice were killed by cervical dislocation and kidneys were removed and placed in RNAlater prior to dissection. Kidneys were dissected whole and cleaned from the adrenal glands by Hong Tao Zhang in Dr. Lu’s lab. Kidneys from two to six animals per strain were pooled and shipped to Kremena Star at Mount Sinai School of Medicine (MSSM). Animals used in this study were between 50 and 99 days of age (average of 62 days; see Table 1).

<Blockquote>
<P><B>Sample Processing:</B> : Samples were processed at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in the laboratory of Dr. Erwin Bottinger. All processing steps were performed Kremena Star. Total RNA was extracted with TRIZOL, followed by Rneasy Mini Kit purification (QUAGEN) by Kremena Star at MSSM. RNA purity was evaluated using the 260/280 nm (protein contamination) and the 260/230 nm (TRIZOL contamination) absorbance ratios, and values had to be greater than 1.9 and 0.8 respectively. Most of the samples 260/280 nm values fell between 1.9 and 2.1 and the majority of the 260/230 nm measurements were in the range 1.8 to 2.3. RNA integrity was assessed with the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. We set a quality threshold at 28s/18s rRNA greater than 0.9 or RNA integrity number (RIN) of greater than 6.9. When the two metrics were in disagreement we gave priority on the RIN value as recommended by the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 technical support representative.
Synthesis of cDNA template from total RNA was performed using the one-cyclecDNA synthesis kit from Affymetrix (Affymetrix, P/N 900431).  The Affymetrix IVT-labeling kit ((Affymetrix, P/N 900449)) was used to synthesize labeled cRNA. The cRNA was evaluated using both the 260/280 ratio (values of 1.9 to 2.1). The cRNA is then sheared using a fragmentation buffer included in the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup (Affymetrix, P/N 900371). Fragmented cRNA samples were accessed with Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (cRNA frgments between 25 and 200 nucleotides are required for optimal hybridization and immediately injected onto the array. The arrays were hybridized and washed following standard Affymetrix protocols.

<P><B>Replication and Sample Balance:</B> We obtained a male sample
pool and female sample pool from each isogenic group. Initially
all strains were represented by male and female samples, however,
not all data sets passed the quality control steps. Forty-two (thirty-one
BXD, D2B6F1 and ten inbred strains) are represented by male and
female samples. For the remaining strains, represented by only one
sex we calculated sex-corrected values for each probe set using
the following algorithm:
<p>1. Compute the difference in expression values between the<br>
ALL_FEMALE_AVE and the ALL_MALE_AVE (n = 100 vs n = 52).<br>
b. Divide these values by 2 (additive sex effect) <br>
c. If a female-only strain subtract the &quot;additive sex effect&quot;
<br>
d. If a male-only strain add the &quot;additive sex effect&quot;<br>
</p>
<P><B>Experimental Design and Batch Structure:</B> The data set consists of arrays processed in twenty-three groups over a six month period (March 2006 to July 2006). Each group consists of 4 to 12 arrays. All arrays were processed using the Affymetrix Eukaryotic Sample and Array Processing protocol (701024 Rev. 3), by a single operator, Kremena Star.
All samples in a group were labeled on the same. The hybridization station accommodates up to 4 samples, and since most of the groups had 12 samples, processed in 3 batches on the same day. Samples were washed in groups of four and kept at 4° C until all 12 (or 4-12) arrays were ready to scan. Samples were scanned in sets of four.

<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the array platform:</P>
<Blockquote>
<P><B>Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array: </B>The <A HREF="http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=moe430-20" target="_blank" class="fs14">430v2</A> array consists of 992936 useful 25-nucleotide probes that estimate the expression of approximately 39,000 transcripts and the majority of known genes and expressed sequence tags. The array sequences were selected late in 2002 using Unigene Build 107 by Affymetrix. The UTHSC group has recently reannotated all probe sets on this array, producing more accurate data on probe and probe set targets. All probes were aligned to the most recent assembly of the Mouse Genome (Build 34, mm6) using Jim Kent's BLAT program. Many of the probe sets have been manually curated by Jing Gu and Rob Williams. </P>

<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About data processing:</P>

<Blockquote>

<P><B>Probe set data from the CHP file: </B>The expression values were generated using RMA. The same simple steps described above were also applied to these values. </Blockquote>

<Blockquote>
<P>Probe level QC: Log2 probe data of all arrays were inspected in DataDesk. Inspection involved examining scatterplots of pairs of arrays for signal homogeneity (i.e., high correlation and linearity of the bivariate plots) and looking at all pairs of correlation coefficients.

<P>Validation of strains and sex of each array data set: A subset of probes and probe sets with a Mendelian pattern of inheritance were used to construct a expression correlation matrix for all arrays and the ideal Mendelian expectation for each strain constructed from the genotypes. There should naturally be a very high correlation in the expression patterns of transcripts with Mendelian phenotypes within each strain, as well as with the genotype strain distribution pattern of markers for the strain.

<P>Sex of the samples was validated using sex-specific probe sets such as <I>Xist</I> and <I>Dby</I>.
