<P>
<B>FINAL RECOMMENDED EYE DATA SET</B>. The HEIMED September 2008 RMA data release provides estimates of gene expression in whole eyes of 103 lines of young adult mice generated using 221 Affymetrix M430 2.0 arrays. This data set is intended for exploration of the genetics and genomics of the mouse eye, retina, lens, retinal pigment epithelium, cornea, iris and choroid. Data were generated at UTHSC with support from a grant from Dr. Barrett Haik, Director of the Hamilton Eye Institute (<a href="http://www.eye.utmem.edu/cvr/hei.html" target="_blank" class="fs14">HEI</a>). We used pooled RNA samples, usually two independent pools--one male, one female pool--for most lines of mice. This data set was processed using the <a href="http://rmaexpress.bmbolstad.com/" target="_blank" class="fs14">RMA</a> protocol. A total of 2223 probes sets are associated with LRS values greater than 46 (LOD >10).

<P class="subtitle">About the cases used to generate this set of data:</P>

<Blockquote>

<P>This is the complete and final HEIMED data set. HEIMED consists of expression data for 103 genetically defined lines of mice with standard errors of the mean. Almost all animals are young adults between 50 and 80 days of age (Table 1, maximum age is 123 days). We measured expression in conventional inbred strains, BXD recombinant inbred (RI) strains, reciprocal F1s between C57BL/6J and DBA/2J, and several mutant and knockout lines. We have combined all common strains, F1 hybrids, and mutants into a group called the Mouse Diversity Panel (MDP). Four lines, namely, C57BL/6J (B6), DBA/2J (D2), and the pair of B6D2F1 and D2B6F1 hybrids are common to both the MDP and the BXD set. This is a breakdown of cases that are part of HEIMED:

<OL>
<LI>68 BXD strains. The first 32 of these strains  are from the Taylor series of BXD strains generated at the Jackson Laboratory by Benjamin A. Taylor. BXD1 through BXD32 were started in the late 1970s, whereas BXD33 through 42 were started in the 1990s. Only one of these strains, BXD24 (know also known as BXD24b), has retinal degeneration (a spontaneous mutation). The other 36 BXD strains (BXD43 and higher) were bred by Lu Lu, Jeremy Peirce, Lee M. Silver, and Robert W. Williams starting in 1997 using B6D2 generation 10 advanced intercross progeny. This modified breeding protocol doubles the number of recombinations per BXD strain and improves mapping resolution (Peirce et al. <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/5/7"  target="_blank" class="fs14">2004</a>). All of the Taylor series of BXD strains and many of the new BXD strains are available from the Jackson Laboratory. All of the new BXD strains (BXD43 and higher) are also available directly from <A HREF="mailto:lulu@nb.utmem.EDU" target="_blank" class="fs14">Lu Lu</A> and colleagues at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in Memphis, TN, USA.

<LI>35 MDP lines, including 26 inbred strains representing closely related substrains (e.g, BALB/cJ and BALB/cByJ), many of the most widely used common <I>Mus musculus domesticus</I> inbred strains (e.g., C57BL/6J and 129S1/SvImJ), inbred but wild-derived representatives of common subspecies (<I>Mus musculus domesticus</I>, e.g, WSB/EiJ; <I>M. musculus musculus</I>, e.g., CZECHII/EiJ; <I>M. musculus molossinus</I>, e.g., MOLF/EiJ; <I>M. musculus castaneus</I>, e.g., CAST/EiJ); and even one different species of mouse (<I>Mus spicilegus</I>, PANCEVO/EiJ). The MDP also includes the reciprocal F1 hybrids (B6D2F1 and D2B6F1) and the following 6 KO lines and the <I>Nyx-nob</I> mutant:

<LI>6 knockouts (KO), including a KO of <I>Rpe65</I>, and 5 <A HREF="http://www.deltagen.com/" target="_empty" class="fs14">DeltaGen Inc.</A> knockout lines provided by Dr. Ted Choi. These KO lines have had a bacterial lacZ construct inserted into the gene. The endogenous promoter drives expression of beta-galactosidase. RT-PCR analysis detects a gene transcript in most tissues. The following KOs from DeltaGen were studied: <I>Gabra1, <A HREF="http://www.informatics.jax.org/javawi2/servlet/WIFetch?page=alleleDetail&key=40055" target="_blank" class="fs14">Gabbr1</A>, Gnb1, <A HREF="http://www.informatics.jax.org/javawi2/servlet/WIFetch?page=alleleDetail&key=40062" target="_blank" class="fs14">Gpr19</A>,</I> and <I>Clcn3</I>. We also included one spontaneous mutant of the <A HREF="http://www.informatics.jax.org/javawi2/servlet/WIFetch?page=alleleDetail&key=6514" target="_blank" class="fs14">nyctalopin</A> (<I>Nyx</I> no b wave "nob") gene (Pardue et al., <A HREF="http://www.iovs.org/cgi/reprint/39/12/2443" target="_blank" class="fs14">1998</A>) that is on a BALB/cByJ background.
</OL>

<P><B>Rod photoreceptor degeneration in inbred mice</B>: Six strains of mice included in HEIMED suffer from severe loss of photoreceptors (mainly rods) and have the equivalent of night blindness in human patients. The death of photoreceptors in these strains occurs by one to two months of age and is often caused by the <I>retinal degeneration 1 (rd1)</I> mutant allele in the rod cyclic-GMP phosphodiesterase 6 beta subunit gene (<I>Pde6b</I>). The following strains are known to have photoreceptor degeneration: C3H/HeJ, FVB/NJ, MOLF/EiJ, SJL/J and BXD24/TyJ. BXD24/TyJ  is now known as BXD24b/TyJ and has nearly complete retinal degeneration. BXD24a/TyJ, a 1988 F80 inbred stock that has been rederived from cryogenic storage, does not have retinal degeneration (stock number 005243) and is an ideal coisogenic control, but is not included in the HEIMED data set.

<P>As expected (Dickerson LW et al., <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez/12470859" target="_blank" class="fs14">2002</A>) and as judged from the absence of rhodopsin expression, one of the DeltaGen KO lines (chloride ion channel 3, <I>Clcn3</I>) also has retinal degeneration: B6129P2F2N1-Clcn3<DeltaGen_KPE356_KO>. Degeneration in this strain is likely to include all rods and all cones. The cone defect is obvious from the decrease in expression of <I>Gnat2</I>, a gene associated with cones and achromatopsia in mice and humans.

<P>Lines of mice were selected using the following criteria:

<UL>
<LI> genetic and phenotypic diversity, including use by the <A HREF="http://aretha.jax.org/pub-cgi/phenome/mpdcgi?rtn=docs/introducing" target="_empty" class="fs14">Phenome Project</A>
<LI> representation of a fairly wide variety of different subspecies of Mus

<LI> their use by the <A HREF="http://www.complextrait.org" target="_empty" class="fs14">Complex Trait Consortium</A> to make the Collaborative Cross (Tel Aviv/Wellcome, Oak Ridge/DOE, and Perth/UWA)
<LI> genome sequence data from three sources (NHGRI, Celera, and Perlegen-NIEHS)
<LI> interesting mutations or knockouts affecting genes with high expression in the eye
<LI> general availability from The Jackson Laboratory. The only exception are the DeltaGen KO mice.
</UL>

<P>We have included all eight parents of the Collaborative Cross (129S1/SvImJ, A/J, C57BL/6J, CAST/EiJ, NOD/LtJ, NZO/HlLtJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ) in the MDP. Fourteen MDP strains have been partially sequenced by Perlegen for the NIEHS, including including 129S1/SvImJ, A/J, AKR/J, BALB/cByJ, C3H/HeJ, CAST/EiJ, DBA/2J, FVB/NJ, KK/HlJ, MOLF/EiJ, NOD/LtJ, NZW/LacJ, PWD/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ (see the GeneNetwork SNP Browser for data, details, and see <A HREF="http://mouse.perlegen.com/mouse/download.html" target="_empty" class="fs14">Perlegen's excellent data resources and browser</A>).

These black reciprocal F1 can be used to detect dominance effects. Comparison of the two reciprocal F1s can be used to detect parental origin (imprinting) effects. The D2B6F1 animals are currently available from the Jackson Laboratory as a special order.)

<P>Most of the common inbred strains harbor mutations in genes the control pigmentation (Silvers, <A HREF="http://www.informatics.jax.org/wksilvers/index.shtml" target="_empty" class="fs14">2008</A> and material above in this INFO file). These gene include the albino and chinchilla alleles of the tyrosinase gene (<I>Tyr</I>, or human <I>OCA1</I>), the brown allele of the tyrosinase related protein 1 (<I>Tyrp1</I>), the pink-eye dilution allele of <I>Oca2</I> (probe set 1418211), the non-agouti (black) and white-bellied alleles of the agouti signaling protein <I>Asip</I>, the steel allele of <I>Kitlg</I>, the dilute allele of <I>Myo5a</I> (probe set 1419754), and the piebald allele of <I>Ednrb</I>. In some of these cases, effects of the mutation are easily detected at the transcript level (<I>Tyrp1, Oca2,</I> and <I>Myo5a</I>), but in the other cases (<I>Tyr, Asip, Ednrb,</I> and <I>Kitlg</I>), mutations do not leave a strong imprint on expression.

<P class="subtitle">About the tissue used to generate this set of data:</P>

<Blockquote>
<P><B>Tissue preparation protocol</B>. Animal were killed by rapid cervical dislocation. Eyes were removed immediately and placed in RNA<I>later</I> at room temperature. Usually six eyes from animals with a common sex, age, and strain were stored in a single tube.

<P>Each array was hybridized with a pool of cRNA from 4 to 8 eyes from 2 to 4 animals. RNA was extracted at UTHSC by Zhiping Jia. If tissue was saved for RNA extraction at a later time, eyes were placed directly in <i>RNAlater</i> (Ambion, Inc.) and treated per the manufacturer’s directions.  If eyes were used for immediate RNA extraction then we proceeded immediately to the next steps.<p>

Dissecting and preparing eyes for RNA extraction
<OL>
<LI>Place eyes for RNA extraction in RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test Inc.) and process per manufacturer’s instructions (in brief form below).
<LI>Store RNA in 75% ethanol at –80 deg. C until use.
</OL>

<P>Total RNA was extracted with RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly we:
<OL>
<LI>homogenize tissue samples in the RNA STAT-60 (1 ml/50 to 100 mg tissue)
<LI>allowed the homogenate to stand for 5 min at room temperature
<LI>added 0.2 ml of chloroform per 1 ml RNA STAT-60
<LI>shook the sample vigorously for 15 sec and let the sample sit at room temperature for 3 min
<LI>centrifuged at 12,000 G for 15 min
<LI>transfered the aqueous phase to a fresh tube
<LI>added 0.5 ml of isopropanol per 1 ml RNA STAT-60
<LI>vortexed and allowed sample to stand at room temperature for 5-10 min
<LI>centrifuged at 12,000 G for 10-15 min
<LI>removed the supernatant and washed the RNA pellet with 75% ethanol
<LI>stored the pellet in 75% ethanol at -80 deg C until use
</OL>

<P><B>Sample Processing</B>. All samples were processed in the VA Medical Center, Memphis, Rheumatology Disease Research Core Center led by Dr. Weikuan Gu. All arrays were processed by Dr. Yan Jiao. In brief, samples were purified using a standard sodium acetate in alcohol method (recommended by Affymetrix). The RNA quality was checked using a 1% agarose gel. The 18S and 28S bands had to be clear and the 28S band had to be more prominent. RNA concentation was measured using a spectrophotometer. The 260/280 ratios had to be greater than 1.7, and the majority were 1.8 or higher. We used a total of 8 micrograms of RNA as starting amount for cDNA synthesis using a standard Eberwine T7 polymerase method (Superscript II RT, Invitrogen Inc., Affy Part No 900431, GeneChip Expression 3' Amplification One-Cyle cDNA Synthesis Kit). The Affymetrix IVT labeling kit (Affy 900449) was used to generate labeled cRNA. At this point the cRNA was evaluated again using both the 260/280 ratio (values of 2.0 or above were acceptable) and 1% agarose gel inspection of the product (a size range from 200 to 7000 bp is considered suitable for use). We used 45 micrograms of labeled cRNA for fragmentation. Those samples that passed both QC steps (<10% usually fail) were then sheared using a fragmentation buffer included in the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module (Part No.900371). After fragmentation, samples were either stored at -80 deg. C until use (roughly one third) or were used immediately for hybridization.

<P><B>Dealing with ocular pigmentation</B>: Variable ocular pigmentation is a potential confound in a study of the whole eye transcriptome. Even the most careful RNA preparations taken from brown and beige colored mice tend to have faint residual pigmentation that affects hybridization signal. To address this problem, Dr. Yan Jiao purified total RNA using the Qiagen RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (Cat No. 74204) all four batches.

<P><B>Replication, sex, and sample balance:</B> Our goal was to obtain data for independent biological sample pools from both sexes for most lines of mice. The four batches of arrays included in this final data set, collectively represent a reasonably well balanced sample of males and females, in general without within-strain-by-sex replication. Two strains are represented by a single male sample pool (BXD29 and A/J). Four lines are represented by two or three male sample pools (all of the five DeltaGen KO line).

<!--ARTHUR:  Note the possible error for Xist for Gnb5<KO>. This strain appears to have both male an female samples, but supposedly they are all male. Please check both mean and error term calculation in the original data-->


The SJL/J may be a single mixed sex sample. Users can study possible sex effects by comparing any results of expression data to that of a surrogate measurement that summarizes the overall sex balance of HEIMED. To do this just compare your data to those of probe sets 1427262_at (<I>Xist</I>, high in females) and probe set 1426438_at (<I>Ddx3y</I>, high in males). These two sex-specific probes are quantitative surrogates for the sex balance in this data set.

<a name="Tech_dupl"></a>

<P><B>Technical duplicates:</B> One sample, highlighted in the tables below, is a technical duplicate. The pair of technical duplicates were both of high quality. For statistical analysis, they should be combined and treated as single biological sample.

<P><B>Batch structure:</B> This data set consists of four batches (Table 2, far right column). The final September 2008 data set consists of a total of 221 arrays and 220 independent samples.

<!-- NUMBERS needs to add up to 221 -->

<!--ARTHUR, PLEASE ADD LINKS TO FTP SITE HERE and fix text -->


<P>This data set is available as a <A HREF="http://www.genenetwork.org/share/data/ref.php?InfoPageName=Eye_M2_0908_R" target="_blank">bulk download in several formats</a>. The data are available as either strain means or the individual arrays. Due to the involved normalization procedures required to correct for batch effects we strongly recommend not using the raw CEL files without special statistical procedures.</P>

<P class="subtitle">About the array platfrom:</P>
<Blockquote>
<P><B>Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays: </B>The <A HREF="http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=moe430-20" target="_blank" class="normal">430 2.0</A> array consists of 992936 25-nucleotide probes that estimate the expression of approximately 39,000 transcripts (many probes overlap and target the same transcript). The array sequences were selected late in 2002 using Unigene Build 107. The array nominally contains the same probe sequences as the old M430A and 430B  array pair. However, we have found that roughy 75000 probes differ between those on A and B arrays and those on the new 430 2.0. </P>

<P>As part of the development of HEIMED, we have manually annotated individual probe sets by sequence alignment to the mouse genome and transcriptome. Approximately 13,000 probe sets that have comparatively high expression in eye and CNS were curated by one of the authors (RWW) and now have specific information on the part of the transcript targeted by each probe set. The other 33,000 transcripts have corresponding data that was generated by Xusheng Wang using computational methods (BLAT analysis combined with annotated genome sequence).

<P>One example may help explain how to exploit this annotation. The four probe sets for rhodopsin include information on the target location. Only the first probe set targets the last two coding exons. The other three probe sets target different parts of the 3’ UTR (mid, distal, and far distal regions). The probe sets can be reordered by from high to low expression using the <I>Sort By</I> function in Search Results pages. In the case of rhodopsin, the probe set that targets that last two coding exons and proximal parts of the 3’ UTR also has the highest expression . Finally, the HEIMED gene descriptions have been customized to help vision researchers. In the case of rhodopsin, the description appended after the gene name reads “rod photoreceptor pigment, retinitis pigmentosa-associated”. For less well known genes this kind of annotation can be extremely useful. For example, the more verbose annotation for Cerkl reads “neuronal survival and apoptosis-related, retinal ganglion cell expressed, retinitis pigmentosa 26); alternative 3' UTR of short form message, intron 2”.

<P class="subtitle">About data values and data processing:</P>

<Blockquote>
<B>Range of Gene Expression in the Eye.</B> Expression of transcripts in the HEIMED and most other GN data sets is measured on a log2 scale. Each unit corresponding approximately to a 2-fold difference in hybridization signal intensity. To simplify comparisons among different data sets and cases, log2 RMA values of each array have been adjusted to an average expression of 8 units and a standard deviation of 2 units (variance stabilized). Values of all 45,101 probe sets in this data set range from a low of 4.8 (<I>Tcf15</I>, probe set 1420281_at) to a high of 15.5 (crystallin gamma C, <I>Crygc</I>, probe set 1422674_s_at). This corresponds to 10.7 units or a 1 to 1700 dynamic range of expression (2^10.73).

<P>We calibrated this log intensity scale using Affymetrix spike-in control probe sets. These 18 control probe sets target exogenous bacterial mRNAs that are added to each sample (a graded dose spike cocktail) during preparation at concentrations of 1.5, 5, 25, and 100 pM. (To find these probe sets, search GN’s ALL search field using the string “AFFX pM”.) A value of 6 or less is equivalent to an mRNA concentration of under 0.4 pM, a value of 8 is equivalent to ~1.5 pM, 9.5 is equivalent to ~5 pM, 11.5 is equivalent to ~25 pM, 13.5 is equivalent to ~100 pM, and a value of 15.5 is equivalent to an mRNA concentration of 400 pM or greater.

<P>This range can be converted to the mRNA molecules per cell in the eye assuming that a value of 8 is equivalent to about 1 mRNA copy per cell (Kanno et al. 2006, see http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/64). Since the expression of rhodopsin mRNA is normally 15 units, we predict that there are 27 or ~128 <I>Rho</I> mRNAs per cell in the whole eye and ~256 in rods themselves (assuming that rods make up about half of all cells in the eye). For this purpose it may be useful to know that a normal mouse eye contains between 6 and 8 million rod photoreceptors (Guo, Lu, and Williams; GN BXD Phenotype ID 11024).

<P>Note that some probe sets with very low expression still provide reliable data. For example, probe set 1440397_at (<I>Cacna2d1</I>) has expression of only 5.5 units (a value that would be declared as "absent" using conventional Affymetrix procedures), but the values for this calcium channel transcript are associated with a very strong cis QTL with an LRS of 79 (LOD = 17). This strong linkage is definitely not due to chance since the probability of the expression data mapping precisely to the location of the parent gene itself is about 10e-16. This indicates a high signal to noise ratio and the detection of significant strain variation of the correct transcript.</P>

<P>The <B>standard error of the mean</B> for the HEIMED data set is computed for 2 to 6 biological replicates. The standard error of such small samples tends to systematically underestimate the population standard error. With n = 2 the underestimate is about 25%, whereas for n = 6 the underestimate is 5%. Gurland and Tripathi (1971) provide a correction and equation for this effect (see Sokal and Rohlf, Biometry, 2nd ed., 1981, p 53 for an equation of the correction factor for small samples of n < 20.)


<B>Probe (cell) level data from the CEL file: </B>These CEL values produced by <a target="_blank" class="fs14" href="http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/product_updates/gcos_download.affx">GCOS</a> are 75% quantiles from a set of 91 pixel values per cell. The CEL files were processed using the <a href="http://rmaexpress.bmbolstad.com/" target="_blank" class="fs14">RMA</a> protocol. We processed the first three batches together. The last batch was processed separately and merged as described below.


<UL>

<LI>Step 1: We added an offset of 1.0 unit to each cell signal to ensure that all values could be logged without generating negative values. We then computed the log base 2 of each cell.

<LI>Step 2: We performed a quantile normalization of the log base 2 values for the total set of arrays  using the same initial steps used by the RMA transform.

<LI>Step 3: We computed the Z scores for each cell value.

<LI>Step 4: We multiplied all Z scores by 2.

<LI>Step 5: We added 8 to the value of all Z scores. The consequence of this simple set of transformations is to produce a set of Z scores that have a mean of 8, a variance of 4, and a standard deviation of 2. The advantage of this modified Z score is that a two-fold difference in expression level corresponds approximately to a 1 unit difference.

<LI>Step 6: Finally, when appropriate, we computed the arithmetic mean of the values for the set of microarrays for each strain. Technical replicates were averaged before computing the mean for independent biological samples.

</UL>

<P>After RMA processing using Biobase affy10 build running under R version 2.7.1, all array data sets were rank-order normalized. This second round of quantile normalization removes much residual non-linearity across arrays and forces every array to have the same distribution of values as the mean of all arrays. Comparative array data quality was then evaluated in DataDesk. Outlier arrays were flagged by visual inspection in DataDesk, usually by means of an analysis of scatter plots and more quantitatively by generating a correlation matrix of all arrays. Those arrays with mean correlation &lt;0.96 versus all other arrays indicates trouble or a biological outlier). In some cases, outliers were expected, such as samples from strains with retinal degeneration (FVB/NJ, NOD/LtJ, MOLF/EiJ, C3H/HeJ and BXD24), samples from wild subspecies such as WSB/EiJ, CAST/EiJ, PWD/PhJ, and PWK/PhJ, and knockouts. However, when arrays were anomolous both within strain and across strains, they were often simply discarded. The assumption is that anomolous data are much more likely due to experimental and technical errors than to informative biological variation. Approximately 10% of arrays were discarded.

<P>After this process, the acceptable set of arrays was renormalized using all step as above, starting with the original RMA procedure, etc.

<P>We reviewed the data set using a new method developed by RW Williams, Jeremy Peirce, and Hongqiang Li. For the full set of arrays that passed standard QC protocols described above, we computed the strain means for the BXD strains, B6, D2, and F1s. Using this set of strain means we then computed LRS scores for all 45101 probe sets and counted the number of transcripts that generated QTLs with LRS values greater than 50. This value (e.g., 1800) represented the QTL harvest for the full data set. We then dropped a single array from the data set, recomputed strain means, and recomputed the number of transcripts with LRS scores great than 50. This value is expected to typically reduce the number of QTLs that reach the criterion level (e.g., 1750 QTLs > 50). This process was repeated for every array to obtain an array-specific difference value--the effect of removing that array on the total QTL count. For example, the loss of a single array might cause a decrease in 50 QTLs. Values ranged from approximately -90 (good arrays) to +40 (bad arrays). This procedure is similar in some ways to a jackknife protocol, although we are not using this procedure to esimate an error term, but rather as a method to polish a data set.

<P>During this process we discovered that nearly 20 arrays in the batch 2 had been mislabeled at some point in processing. We computed the correct strain membership of each array using a large number of Mendelian probe sets (more than 50) and comparing their match to standard SNP and microsatellite markers and the original array data set of November 2005. This allowed us to rescue a large number of arrays that were of high quality.

<P>A third batch of approximately 40 arrays were processed by Yan Jiao and Weikuan Gu in August 2006. These complete data set assembled by Hongqiang Li. This process again included a correction for a batch effect.

<P>For the June 2006 data set Hongqiang Li used a new batch correction method that stabilizes the range of expression in each batch. For each of the three large batches, we extracted the minumum and maximum raw probe expression (CEL file level) value. We then adjusted raw probe values in each batch to have the same range as the first and largest batch (batch 1) using a simple linear interpolation. These procedures generated new correct CEL files which were then used with RMA to generate final probe set estimates.

<P>For the final fourth batch of arrays (Sept 2008) Arthur Centeno and Rob Williams corrected for a systematic difference in probe set expression values between original arrays run in 2005 and 2006 and the new arrays added in 2008 (n = 45 acceptable arrays). This difference is due to unknown technical batch effects that are probably associated with labeling, hybridization, and scanning. We performed a simple correction to normalize values of the new set of arrays to those of the old set (batches 1 through 3). No changes were made to any values of the previous three batches. We corrected only the probe set level (RMA) values and not the CEL files. For this final batch,  we corrected for the difference (offset) in probe set expression between the first three batches arrays run in 2005 and 2006 (a total of


<!-- ARTHUR, Please check and fix -->

174 acceptable arrays) and the new batch (n = 47 acceptable arrays).


This difference is due to unknown technical effects that are probably related to various steps in labeling, hybridization, and scanning. The correction was applied as follows: (1) RWW selected 51 high quality arrays with similar expression characteristics (r = 0.97 or better between pairs of arrays) in the old data set (from batches 1, 2, and 3) and 34 high quality arrays in the final batch. RWW used scatterplots of full RMA transcriptome data sets to review many pairs of arrays within these new and old array batches. Strains with retinal degeneration or unusual eye gene expression characteristics were excluded from these selected subsets. The average expression values for each probe set were then computed for both the old and new array subsets. The offset value (old minus new) was added to each probe set across all 47 new arrays. This processes forces the average probe set in the new arrays to be very close to that of the previous arrays.

<P><B>Experiment type</B>   Expression profiling by array
<P><B>Summary</B>   The HEIMED September 2008 RMA data release provides estimates of gene expression in whole eyes of 103 lines of young adult mice generated using 221 Affymetrix M430 2.0 arrays. This data set is intended for exploration of the genetics and genomics of the mouse eye, retina, lens, retinal pigment epithelium, cornea, iris and choroid.

<P><B>Overall design</B>   We used pooled RNA samples of whole eyes, usually two independent pools--one male, one female pool--for most lines of mice. This data set was processed using the <a href="http://rmaexpress.bmbolstad.com/" target="_blank" class="fs14">RMA</a> protocol. A total of 2223 probes sets are associated with LRS values greater than 46 (LOD >10).
