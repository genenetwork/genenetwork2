# GeneNetwork

This repository contains the source code for the GeneNetwork (GN)
server http://gn2.genenetwork.org/ (version 2 aka GN2). GN is a Web
2.0 style framework with included tools for doing genetics online
using high-throughput data. GN is used for a wide range of studies. An
exhaustive list of publications mentioning GN and its previous
incarnation WebQTL can be found
[here](http://www.genenetwork.org/reference.html).

## Install

The recommended installation is with GNU Guix which allows you to
deploy GN2 and dependencies as a self contained unit on any machine.
The database can be run separately as well as the source tree (for
developers).  See the [installation docs](doc/README.org).

## Run

Once installed GN2 can be run online through a browser interface

```sh
genenetwork2
```

(default is http://localhost:5003/). A quick example is

```sh
env GN2_PROFILE=~/opt/gn-latest SERVER_PORT=5300 GENENETWORK_FILES=~/data/gn2_data/ ./bin/genenetwork2 ./etc/default_settings.py -gunicorn-dev
```

or you could use the debug script for development purposes:

```sh
env GN2_PROFILE=~/opt/gn-latest SERVER_PORT=5012 ./scripts/run_debug.sh
```

For full examples (you may need to set a number of environment
variables), including running scripts and a Python REPL, also see the
startup script [./bin/genenetwork2](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/blob/testing/bin/genenetwork2).

Also Mysql and Elasticsearch need to be running, see
[INSTALL](./doc/README.org).

## Testing

We are building 'Mechanical Rob' automated testing using Python
[requests](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/tree/master/test/lib)
which can be run with something like

```sh
env GN2_PROFILE=~/opt/gn-latest ./bin/genenetwork2 ./etc/default_settings.py -c ../test/requests/test-website.py -a http://localhost:5003
```

The GN2_PROFILE is the Guix profile that contains all
dependencies. The ./bin/genenetwork2 script sets up the environment
and executes test-website.py in a Python interpreter. The -a switch
says to run all tests and the URL points to the running GN2 http
server.

## Documentation

User documentation can be found
[here](http://gn2.genenetwork.org/help).  The architecture of the
software stack is described [here](./doc/Architecture.org).  The
database schema is (still) shared with GN1 and currently described
[here](http://www.genenetwork.org/webqtl/main.py?FormID=schemaShowPage). Software
documentation is being expanded in the
[source code repository](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/tree/master/doc).

## Contributing

Issues can be raised through
[github](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/issues).

Contribute to GN2 source code by forking the
[github repository](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/) with
git and sending us pull requests.

For development GN2 has a
[mailing list](http://listserv.uthsc.edu/mailman/listinfo/genenetwork-dev)
and an active IRC channel #genenetwork on freenode.net with a
[web interface](http://webchat.freenode.net/).
