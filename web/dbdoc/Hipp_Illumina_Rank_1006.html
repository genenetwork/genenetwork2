Twenty-seven Mouse-6 slides and a total of 160 samples passed stringent quality control and error checking. We should note that this is our first experience using the Illumina platform and the initial set of 13 slides were are not included. This particular data set was processed using a very simple probe "Rank" protocol described below. Values were log2 transformed and the current data range from 6 (very low or no expression) to 16.5 (extremely high).

<P>As a measure of data quality we often count the number of probes that are associated with LOD scores of greater than 10 (LRS > 46). In this initial data set, 1167 probes have LRS values >46. The maximum LRS achieved in this data set is 358.1 for probe ILM103520706 (Disabled 1; <I>Dab1</I>).

<P>ABOUT THE HIPPOCAMPUS. The hippocampus is an important and intriguing part of the forebrain that is crucial in memory formation and retrieval. This region of the brain is particularly vulnerable to the effects of environmental stressors and is a key upstream modulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (the HPA). The hippocampus is also often affected in epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia. Unlike most other parts of the brain, the hippocampus contains a remarkable population of stems cells that continue to generate neurons and glial cells even in adult mammals (Kempermann, <A HREF="http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Medicine/Neurology/~~/c2Y9Y29taW5nc29vbiZzcz1wdWJkYXRlLmFzYyZzZD1hc2MmcGY9MTAmdmlldz11c2EmcHI9MTAmYm9va0NvdmVycz15ZXMmY2k9MDE5NTE3OTcxNA==" target="_empty" class="fs14">2005</A>). This genetic analysis of transcript expression in the hippocampus (dentate gyrus, CA1-CA3) is a joint effort of 14 investigators supported by numerous agencies described in the Acknowledgments section.

About the strains used to generate this set of data:</P>

<blockquote>
<P>The <A HREF="http://www.genenetwork.org/mouseCross.html#LXS" target="_empty" class="fs14">LXS</A> genetic reference panel of recombinant inbred strains consists of just over 77 strains. All of these strains have been inbred for more than 23 generations (F23). All strains have been genotyped at 13,377 SNPs. Thanks to the efforts of <A HREF="http://www.gnf.org/technology/organismal/mamm-genetics-haplotype-mutation-mapping.htm" target="_empty" class="fs14">Dr. Timothy Wiltshire</A> at the Genome Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation, the two parental strains have been genotyped at 156,551 SNPs.

<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the animals and tissue used to generate this set of data:</P>

<Blockquote><P>All animals were raised at the IBG by Bennett and colleagues in an SPF facility. No cases were MHV positive. Mice were killed by cervical dislocation. Whole brain dissections were performed at the IBG by Bennett and colleagues and shipped in RNAlater to Lu Lu and colleagues at UTHSC. Most hippocampal dissections (all were bilateral) were performed by Zhiping Jia. Cerebella, olfactory bulbs, and brain stems were also dissected and stored at -80 deg C using further use. Hippocampal samples are very close to complete (see Lu et al., <A HREF="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/21/10/35032001)" target="_empty" class="fs14">2001</A> but probably include variable amounts of fimbria and choroid plexus (see expression of transthyretin, <I>Ttr</I>, as a marker of choroid plexus).

<P>A pool of dissected tissue from four hippocampi taken from two naive adults of the same strain, sex, and age was collected in one session and used to generate RNA samples. The great majority (75%) of animals were sacrificed between 9:30 AM and 11:30 AM. All animals were sacrificed between 9 AM and 5 PM during the light phase. All RNA samples were extracted at UTHSC by Zhiping Jia.

<P>All animals used in this study were between 53 and 90 days of age (average of 72 days; see Table 1 below).

<P><B>Sample Processing:</B> Samples were processed by Lu Lu and colleagues in the Illumina Core at UTHSC between July 25 and Dec 20, 2006. All processing steps below were performed by Feng Jiao.

<P>RNA Extraction: In brief, we used the RNA STAT-60 <A HREF="http://www.tel-test.com/prod02.htm" target="_empty" class="fs14">protocol</A> (TEL-TEST "B" Bulletin No. 1), steps 5.1A (homogenization of tissue), 5.2 (RNA extraction), 5.3 (RNA precipitation), and 5.4 (RNA wash). In Step 5.4 we stopped after adding 75% ethanol (1 ml per 1 ml RNA STAT-60) and stored the mix at -80 deg C until further use. Before RNA labeling we thawed samples and proceeded with the remainder of Step 5.4; pelleting, drying, and redissovling the pellet in RNAase-free water.

<!--FULL TEL-TEST text on RNA-60 Stat protocol


<P>5. PROTOCOL:  RNA/mRNA isolation by the RNA STAT-60 method includes the
following steps:

<br>1. Homogenization RNA STAT-60TM&nbsp;(1 ml per 50-100 mg tissue, or 5-10 x 10-6 cells)
<br>2. RNA Extraction 1 vol. of homogenate +0.2 vol. of chloroform
<br>3. RNA Precipitation 0.5 vol. of isopropanol
<br>4. RNA Wash 75% ethanol

<P>Unless stated otherwise the procedure is carried out at room temperature.

<P>5.1 HOMOGENIZATION

<P>A. TISSUES: Homogenize tissues samples in the RNA STAT-60(1 ml/50-100mg tissue)</B> in a glass-Teflon or Polytron homogenizer. Sample volume should not  exceed 10% of the volume of the RNA STAT-60 used for homogenization.

<P>B. CELLS: Cells grown in mono layer are lysed directly in a culture dish by adding the RNA STAT-60TM (1 ml/3.5 cm petri dish) and passing the cell lysate several times through a pipette. Cells grown in suspension are sediment then lysed in the RNA STAT-60TM (1 ml per 5-10 x 106 cells) by repetitive pipetting. Washing calls before addition of the RNA STAT-60TM should be avoided as this increases the possibility of mRNA degradation. <br>

<P>5.2 RNA EXTRACTION: Following homogenization, store the homogenate for 5 min at room temp to permit the complete dissociation of nucleoprotein complexes. Next, add 0.2 ml of chloroform per 1 ml of the RNA STAT-60, cover the sample tightly, shake vigorously for 15 seconds and let it stay at room temperature for 2-3minutes. Centrifuge the homogenate at 12,000g (max) for 15 minutes at 4 deg C. Following centrifugation, the homogenate separates into two phases: a lower red phenol chloroform phase and the colorless upper aqueous phase. RNA remains exclusively in the aqueous phase whereas DNA and proteins are in the interferes and organic phase. The volume of the aqueous phase is about 60%  of the volume of RNA STAT-60 used for homogenization.

<P>5.3 RNA PRECIPITATION: Transfer the aqueous phase to a fresh tube and mix with isopropanol. Add 0.5 ml of isopropanol per 1 ml of the RNA STAT-60 used for homogenization. Store samples at room temp for 5-10 minutes and centrifuge at 12,000g (max.) for 10 min at 4 deg C</B>. RNA precipitate (often visible before  centrifugation) forms a white pellet at the bottom of the tube.

<P>5.4 RNA WASH: Remove supernatant and wash the RNA pellet once with 75% ethanol by vortexing and subsequent centrifugation at 7,500g (max.) for 5 min at 4<SUP>o</SUP>C. Add at least <B>1 ml of 75% ethanol per 1 ml of the RNA STAT-60 used  for the initial homogenization.

<P>At the end of the procedure, dry the RNA pellet briefly by air-drying or in a vacuum (5-10 min.). It is important not to let the RNA pellet dry completly as it will greatly decrease its solubility. Do not use the Speed-Vac for drying. Dissolve the  RNA pellet in water or in 1 mm EDTA, pH 7, or 0.5% SDS solution. Vortex or pass the pellet a few times through a pipette  tip. An incubation for <B>10-15 minutes at  55-60<SUP>o</SUP>C</B> may be required to dissolve RNA samples. Diethylpyrocarbonate  (DEPC) treated RNase-free solutions<SUP>1</SUP> should be used for solubilization of RNA.


END OF HIDDEN PROTOCOL TEXT-->


<P>RNA Labeling: In brief, RNA purity was evaluated using the 260/280 nm absorbance ratio, and values had to be greater than 1.8 to pass our quality control (QC). The majority of samples had values between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was assessed using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. The standard Eberwine T7 polymerase method was used to catalyze the synthesis of cDNA template from polyA-tailed RNA using the Ambion/Illumina (http://www.ambion.com/catalog/CatNum.php?AMIL1791) TotalPrep RNA amplication kit (Cat#IL1791). The biotin labeled cRNA was then evaluated using both the 260/280 ratio (values of 2.0-2.3 are acceptable) using a NanoDrop ND-1000 (http://www.nanodrop.com/nd-1000-overview.html). Those samples that passed QC steps (1-3% failed and new RNA samples had to be acquired and processed) were immediately used on the original Mouse-6 v 1.0 slide. The slides were hybridized and washed following standard Illumina protocols.

<P><B>Replication and Sample Balance:</B> We obtained a male sample pool and female sample pool from each strain. While all strains were orginally represented by matched male and female samples, one strain LXS34 consists of two female samples. Given the expression of Xist, we suspect that strain LXS114 is represented by two male pools (see figure at bottom of page).


<P><B>Experimental Design and Batch Structure:</B> This data set consists arrays processed in 13 groups over a five month period (July 2006 to Dec 2006). Most groups consisted of 12 samples. All arrays in this data set were processed using a single protocol by a single operator, Feng Yiao. Processing was supervised directly by Dr. Lu Lu. All samples were scanned on a single Illumina Beadstation housed in the Hamilton Eye Institute between July 28 and Dec 21, 2006. Details on sample assignment to slides and batches is provide in the table below.

<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the array platform:</P>
<Blockquote>
<P><B>Illumina Sentrix Mouse-6 BeadArray Platform: </B>The <A HREF="http://www.illumina.com" target="_blank" class="fs14">Mouse6</A> array consists of 46,116 unique probe sequences, each 50 nucleotides in length, that have been arrayed on glass slides using a novel bead technology.

<P>Dunning M, Smith M, Thorne N, Tavare S (2006) beadarray: An R package to analyse Illumina BeadArrays. R News (the Newsletter of the P Project) 6:17-23. (see pages 17-23 of http://CRAN.R-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2006-5.pdf).

<P>ANNOTATION:  In spring of 2007, Robert W. Williams and Hongqiang Li reannotated the Illumina Mouse-6 array content. This new annotation is now incorporated into GeneNetwork. For 46166 probes on the Mouse 6 array platform (including control probes) we have identified 35975 NCBI Entrez Gene IDs; 26481 matched human Gene IDs; 23899 matched rat Gene IDs; 26883 NCBI HomoloGene IDs; and 12791 OMIM IDs.

<P>Position data for the 50-mer Illumina Mouse-6 array were initially downloaded from Sanger at http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Users/avc/Illumina/Mouse-6_V1.gff.gz but we then updated all positions by BLAT analysis from mm6 positions to mm8 positions (Hongqiang Li).</P>

<Blockquote>
<P>This data set uses a simple ranking method. Mean probe values given by Illumina output files were logged and then ranked within each of the sample data sets. This results in a rank vector (from 1 to 46116) for each array and a corresponding log2 value vector for the same array. We then compute the average log2 value corresponding to each of the rank values. For example, the average value for the 101th ranked probes across all arrays may have a mean value of 15.000 on the log2 scale. The 101th-ranked probes will naturally have many different gene identities across the many arrays although all of these genes/probes will share quite high expression. The average log2 value for each of the ranks is then used as a "look up" table for each rank in the individual arrays. For example if the 101th-ranked probe had a value of 15.321 on Array49 and a value of 14.872 on Array50, then both of these values would be reassigned the mean value of rank 101 of 15.000. As a result every array data set has exactly the same log2 distribution of expression values.

<P>Sex of the samples was validated using sex-specific probe set: <I>Xist</I> (probe ILM106520068, also known as scl00213742.1_141-S).

<DIR><P><SMALL><B>Legend:</B> Checking that the sex of samples was labeled correctly in mouse array data sets using <I>Xist</I> expression measured by probe ILM106520068. In this bar chart the expression of <I>Xist</I> is very low in LXS114 and has a low error term. This is because both arrays are male samples rather than 1 male and 1 female sample. In contrast LXS34 has very high expression and no error bar because the sample is from a single female pool.  </SMALL></P>
