AXB/BXA Published Phenotypes Database

 <A HREF="/webqtl/main.py?FormID=editHtml"><img src="/images/modify.gif" alt="modify this page" border= 0 valign="middle"></A></P>


<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary:</P>

<Blockquote><P>
This AXB/BXA Phenotype Database includes published trait data for up to 27 recombinant inbred strains. Data were collected and curated at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC) starting in 2000. New traits  are still being added.</P>
</Blockquote>


<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the cases used in these studies:</P>

<Blockquote><P>
The AXB and BXA recombinant inbred strains were derived from a reciprocal cross between A/J (A) and C57BL/6J (B6 or B). Both parental strains have been sequenced, making this a particularly powerful set of RI strains for functional and genetic analyses. Data acquired using AXB and BXA subsets should be combined; the only difference being the polarity of intercross matings that generated (A x B)F1s and (B x A)F1s. AXB and BXA strains were all produced by Muriel Nesbitt at UCSD in the mid and late 1970s and first used in the early 1980s (Skamene et al., 1984; Peleg and Nesbitt, 1984; Marshal and Paigen, <a href="http://jaxmice.jax.org/library/notes/454a.htm" target="_blank" class="fs14">1993</a>). The set was imported into The Jackson Laboratory by Beverly Paigen (Pgn) in the early 1990s. As of 2004, approximately 25 viable and fully independent AXB/BXA strains are available.
</P>

<P>Several nominally independent strains in the AXB and BXA sets are very closely related. These duplicates should not be used without special statistical precaution. The most obvious option is to combine and average data from these strains except when their phenotypes differ significantly (Taylor <a href="http://jaxmice.jax.org/library/notes/465b.html" target="_blank" class="fs14">1996</a>; Williams et al., <a href="http://genomebiology.com/2001/2/11/research/0046" target="_blank" class="fs14">2001</a>). 

<BR>
<BR>AXB13=AXB14: 92% identity
<BR>AXB18=AXB19=AXB20:  97 to 99% identity
<BR>BXA8=BXA17: 99.8% identity
</P>

<P>AXB18/PgnJ is now referred to as AXB19a/PgnJ (JAX stock number 001686)
<P>AXB20/PgnJ is now referred to as AXB19b/PgnJ (JAX stock number 001688)

<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the acquisition these data:</P>
<Blockquote><P>Published phenotypes were obtained through a literature search of all PubMed indexed journals. Whenever possible,  exact values of graphically represented data were obtained from the authors. In all other cases graphs were measured using a vernier caliper. Additional published and unpublished phenotypes were submitted directly by investigators. These records have Record ID numbers less than 1.

<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Submitting data and reporting errors:</P>
<Blockquote><P>The utility of the AXB/BXA phenotype database increases significantly as each new phenotype is incorporated.

The initial construction of this phenotype database was performed with the help of Ryan McNeive, Nathan Copeland, and Mary-Kathleen Sullivan at University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center with support by a Human Brain Project to RWW. The extension and curation of these RI phenotype files is managed by Elissa J. Chesler. </P></Blockquote>
